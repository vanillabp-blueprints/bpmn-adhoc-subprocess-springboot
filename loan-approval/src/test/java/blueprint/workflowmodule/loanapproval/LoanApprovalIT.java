/**
 * The integration test of this workflow module: it starts a real workflow in a real BPMS
 * and waits for the ad-hoc subprocess to have run the activities somebody picked.
 *
 * <p>
 * One test per decision maker, because that is the aspect of this blueprint: the same
 * element serves a choice made by a person and a choice made by a decision table, and the
 * model does not know which of them it was. Each test asserts on the workflow aggregate,
 * never on the engine, and waits rather than asserting immediately.
