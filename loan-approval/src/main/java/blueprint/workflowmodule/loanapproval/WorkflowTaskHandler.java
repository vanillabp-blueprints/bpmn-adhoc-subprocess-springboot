/**
 * What the process tells the application: the incoming half of the BPMN wiring.
 *
 * <p>
 * The three checks are the activities inside the ad-hoc subprocess, and they are the point
 * of this class: each of them is an ordinary {@code @WorkflowTask} method, written exactly
 * as it would be for a task on a sequence flow. Only some of them are called for a given
 * workflow, and which ones is nothing this class decides or learns. There is deliberately
 * no method for the subprocess itself - it is not a task of the application.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * There is no {@code @Transactional} here, and adding one would be a mistake. VanillaBP
 * loads the aggregate, runs the method and saves the aggregate in one transaction it owns.
 * A transaction declared by the application would take that guarantee away, which is why
 * such an annotation on this class or on a {@code @WorkflowTask} method fails the boot
 * naming the method.
 * </p>
