/**
 * The business service of this use case: what the application can do with a loan approval,
 * expressed without a single word about processes.
 *
 * <p>
 * It never touches VanillaBP. Whenever the business case moves on, it tells {@link Workflow}
 * what happened, {@code checksSelected} rather than "complete the user task", and that class
 * decides what this means for the BPMN. The other direction runs through
 * {@link WorkflowTaskHandler}, which calls the methods below when the process reaches a
 * task.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The methods running the checks are what the ad-hoc subprocess activates. Nothing here
 * knows that they sit inside such an element, and nothing here decides which of them run:
 * {@link #selectChecks} writes the picked ids onto the workflow aggregate, and the model
 * reads them.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note where {@code @Transactional} sits. It is on the methods the API calls, because
 * starting a workflow and answering a user task have to run in a transaction. It is
 * deliberately absent from the methods a task handler calls: VanillaBP already runs a task
 * in a transaction it owns, and a transaction declared here would break the guarantees that
 * come with it. VanillaBP sees such a transaction and fails the task naming it, so the
 * mistake shows up rather than costing data.
 * </p>
