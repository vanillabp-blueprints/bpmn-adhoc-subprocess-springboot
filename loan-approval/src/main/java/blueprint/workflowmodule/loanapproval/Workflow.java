/**
 * What the application tells the process: the outgoing half of the BPMN wiring.
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link Service} calls in, naming what happened in business terms ({@code checksSelected}),
 * and this class translates that into whatever the process needs. {@link ProcessService} is
 * injected here and nowhere else.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * There is nothing here about the ad-hoc subprocess, and that is worth noticing. Which of
 * its activities run is not an instruction the application sends, it is an attribute of the
 * workflow aggregate the model reads. So this class only completes the user task, and the
 * aggregate saved along with that completion carries the choice.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Both methods have to run in a transaction, which is why the class carries
 * {@code @Transactional}: the aggregate is saved along with the answer, and on a remote
 * BPMS the answer is only sent after that transaction committed. A rollback therefore
 * takes the completion with it and leaves the task open, rather than completing a task for
 * work that was undone.
 * </p>
