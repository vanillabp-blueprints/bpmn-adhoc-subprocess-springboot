/**
 * The workflow aggregate: one entity per workflow instance, holding everything the
 * process needs to know. There are no process variables - this is the single source of
 * truth, and it stays a normal JPA entity your application can use like any other.
 *
 * <p>
 * The attribute this blueprint is about is {@link #checksToRun}. It holds the ids of the
 * BPMN elements inside the ad-hoc subprocess which are supposed to run, VanillaBP shares
 * the aggregate with the BPMS on every command it sends, and a collection travels as a
 * list, so the expression of the model can read it. Nothing else is needed to drive the
 * element.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * {@link #version} is here because the checks run at the same time and each of them writes
 * this row. Without it the transaction committing second would write back what it read at
 * its start and the other check's result would be gone, with no exception and no log line.
 * With it the collision is an optimistic locking exception, VanillaBP passes it on and the
 * BPMS retries the task. Which other ways there are to deal with two writers, and when each
 * of them fits, is shown by
 * <a href="https://github.com/vanillabp-blueprints/persistence-parallel-branches-springboot">
 * <code>persistence-parallel-branches</code></a>.
 * </p>
